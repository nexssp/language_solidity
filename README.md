## Examples

Nexss Programmer uses `solc` under the hood and installing it from sources.

Please not that for **linux** atm `cmake` is also _build from sources_, so it is taking a bit of time. Please let us know if you have any suggestions how to improve it.

```sh
nexss yourfile.sol --help
nexss yourfile.sol --gas
nexss yourfile.sol --asm
...
```
